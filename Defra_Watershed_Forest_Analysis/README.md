## This folder contains code used to calculate statistics on forest loss, biomass loss, restoration potential, and potential carbon sequestration in watersheds near cities in the Cities4Forests Program.
The analysis was done in three steps:
1. Watershed Preprocessing
2. Forest Loss and Biomass Loss Calculation
3. Restoration and Carbon Sequestration Potential Calculation
